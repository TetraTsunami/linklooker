# LinkLooker

## What is it?
This is a browser extension inspired by the hover-to-summarize-link features of some browsers. To use it, hover the cursor over a link and press `ctrl` after configuring an OpenAI API key in the settings.

It grabs the title, publisher-provided summary, and cover image from the OpenGraph protocol, then sends a user-configurable amount of the page content to OpenAI for further summary.
