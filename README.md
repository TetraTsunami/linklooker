# LinkLooker

## What is it?
This is a browser extension inspired by the hover-to-summarize-link features of some browsers. To use it, hover the cursor over a link and press `shift`.

It grabs the title, publisher-provided summary, and cover image using HTML tags on the targetted page, and it can send a user-configurable amount of the page content to an OpenAI endpoint for further summary (pending configuration of an API key in the settings).
